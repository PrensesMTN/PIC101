## Overview
The PIC12F629 is a popular 8-bit microcontroller manufactured by Microchip Technology. Due to its simplicity and versatility, it is widely used in embedded systems and educational projects. This microcontroller is a part of the PIC (Peripheral Interface Controller) family and offers fundamental features.

## Key Features
- 8-bit CPU
- 1,024 words of Flash program memory
- 64 bytes of RAM
- 128 bytes of EEPROM data memory
- 6 I/O pins
- Timer0 module
- Low power consumption
- Up to 20 MHz maximum operating frequency
- In-Circuit Serial Programming™ (ICSP™) support

## Development Tools
To begin working with the PIC12F629 microcontroller, you will need the following tools:
- PIC12F629 microcontroller (IC)
- A programmer (e.g., PICkit) to load code onto the IC
- A development board or a custom circuit for the microcontroller
- A PIC development environment (e.g., MPLAB X IDE)
- PIC programming software (e.g., MPLAB X IPE)

## Getting Started
1. Set up your PIC development environment with the required software and programmer.
2. Create a new project or source code file for your PIC12F629 project.
3. Write your code using the PIC assembly language or a high-level language like C.
4. Compile or assemble your code to generate a binary file.
5. Use the programmer to flash the code onto the PIC12F629 IC.
6. Connect the IC to your development board or custom circuit.

## Sample Code
Here's a simple example of code in assembly language to control an LED:

```assembly
; PIC12F629 LED Blinking Example

BSF     STATUS, RP0      ; Bank 1
MOVLW   B'00000000'      ; Set GPIO as output
MOVWF   TRISIO
BCF     STATUS, RP0      ; Bank 0

LOOP:
    BSF     GPIO, 0     ; Turn on the LED (assuming connected to RB0)
    CALL    DELAY       ; Call a delay function
    BCF     GPIO, 0     ; Turn off the LED
    CALL    DELAY       ; Call a delay function
    GOTO    LOOP

DELAY:
    ; Delay function implementation here
    RETURN
```
