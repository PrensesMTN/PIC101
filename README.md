## What is PIC?

PIC microcontrollers are a popular microcontroller family used across a wide range of applications. They find applications in anything from simple electronic projects to complex industrial setups. Programming a PIC can be a rewarding experience, offering versatility and practical learning.

## What is Assembly?

Assembly language is a low-level programming language designed for writing code that runs directly on hardware, such as microcontrollers. It provides precise control over the computer's processor and aids in creating fast and optimized code.

## What is C(programming language)?

C is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, protocol stacks, though decreasingly for application software.[7] C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up your PIC microcontroller development environment.
  - You'll need the following tools:
  - PICxxxx microcontrollers (IC)
  - Programmer (e.g., PICkit) for flashing code onto the IC
  - Development board or a custom circuit for the microcontroller (e.g., Proteus 8, PICKIT 3 Mini)
  - PIC development environment (e.g., MPLAB X IDE)
  - PIC programming software (e.g., MPLAB X IPE)

3. Upload the code to your microcontroller.
4. Observe the serial communication in action.
