## What is Assembly?

Assembly language is a low-level programming language designed for writing code that runs directly on hardware, such as microcontrollers. It provides precise control over the computer's processor and aids in creating fast and optimized code.

## What is PIC?

PIC microcontrollers are a popular microcontroller family used across a wide range of applications. They find applications in anything from simple electronic projects to complex industrial setups. Programming a PIC can be a rewarding experience, offering versatility and practical learning.
